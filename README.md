# STEVEN UNIVERSE GAME

I modeled my game after the cartoon Steven Universe. The rules are quite simple. At the beginning of the game you will be given a random number. It's your job to click one of the four characters (Crystal Gems): Steven Universe, Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl and try to match that random number. You won't find out the value of each of the characters until you click one. If your score  goes over the random number then you lose. Each tiime you play, you'll receive a new random number and a new set of values for each character.
